# GWOApi
```python
from GWO import GWOApi
```
Basically the main thing of the package, it initiates your api session you **cannot** use the package without this.

To initiate GWOApi please for the love of god **do not use** `#!python GWOApi()` unless you are reinventing the wheel!!! You want to use `#!python GWOApi.login()`
